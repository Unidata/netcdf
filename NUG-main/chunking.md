# Improving Performance with Chunking {#netcdf_perf_chunking}

[TOC]

## The Chunk Cache {#chunk_cache}

For good performance your chunk cache must be larger than one chunk of your data - preferably large enough to hold multiple chunks of data.

In addition, when a file is opened (or a variable created in an open file), the netCDF-4 library checks to make sure the default chunk cache size will work for that variable.
The cache will be large enough to hold N chunks, up to a maximum size of M bytes. (Both N and M are settable at configure time with the `–with-default-chunks-in-cache` and the `–with-max-default-cache-size` options added to the configure script.
Currently they are set to **10** and **64** MB.)

To change the default chunk cache size, use the `set_chunk_cache()` function before opening the file with nc_set_chunk_cache().
Fortran 77 programmers see `NF_SET_CHUNK_CACHE()`).
Fortran 90 programmers use the optional `cache_size`, `cache_nelems`, and `cache_preemption` parameters to `nf90_open()/nf90_create()` to change the chunk size before opening the file.

To change the per-variable cache size, use the set_var_chunk_cache function at any time on an open file.
C programmers see `nc_set_var_chunk_cache()`, Fortran 77 programmers see `NF_SET_VAR_CHUNK_CACHE()`.

## The Default Chunking Scheme {#default_chunking_4_1}

Unfortunately, there are no general-purpose chunking defaults that are optimal for all uses.
Different patterns of access lead to different chunk shapes and sizes for optimum access.
Optimizing for a single specific pattern of access can degrade performance for other access patterns.  
By creating or rewriting datasets using appropriate chunking, it is sometimes possible to support efficient access for multiple patterns of access.

If you don't know or can't anticipate what access patterns will be most common, or you want to store a variable in a way that will support reasonable access along any of its dimensions, you can use the library's default chunking strategy.

The size and shape of chunks for each individual variable are determined at creation time by the size of each variable element and by the shape of the variable, specified by the ordered list of its dimensions and the lengths of each dimension, with special rules for unlimited dimensions.

The best default chunk size would be as large as possible without exceeding the size of a physical disk access.
However, block sizes differ for different file systems and platforms, and in particular may be different when the data is first written and later read.
Currently the netCDF default chunk size is 4MiB, which is reasonable for filesystems on high-performance computing platforms.
A different default may be specified at configuration time when building the library from source, for example 4KiB for filesystems with small physical block sizes.

The current default chunking strategy of the netCDF library is to balance access time along any of a variable's dimensions, by using chunk shapes similar to the shape of the entire variable but small enough that the resulting chunk size is less than or equal to the default chunk size.
This differs from an earlier default chunking strategy that always used one for the length of a chunk along any unlimited dimension, and otherwise divided up the number of chunks along fixed dimensions to keep chunk sizes less than or equal to the default chunk size.

A pragmatic exception to the default strategy is used for variables that only have a single unlimited dimension, for example time series with only a time dimension.
In that case, in order to avoid chunks much larger than needed when there are only a small number of records, the chunk sizes for such variables are limited to 4KiB.
This may be overridden by explicitly setting the chunk shapes for such variables.

## Chunking and Parallel I/O {#chunking_parallel_io}

When files are opened for read/write parallel I/O access, the chunk cache is not used.
Therefore it is important to open parallel files with read only access when possible, to achieve the best performance.

## A Utility to Help Benchmark Results: bm_file {#bm_file}

The `bm_file` utility may be used to copy files, from one netCDF format to another, changing chunking, filter, parallel I/O, and other parameters.
This program may be used for benchmarking netCDF performance for user data files with a range of choices, allowing data producers to pick settings that best serve their user base.

NetCDF must have been configured with `–enable-benchmarks` at build time for the `bm_file` program to be built. \
When built with `–enable-benchmarks`, netCDF will include tests (run with “make check”) that will run the `bm_file` program on sample data files.

Since data files and their access patterns vary from case to case, these benchmark tests are intended to suggest further use of the `bm_file` program for users.

Here's an example of a call to bm_file:

````
     ./bm_file -d -f 3 -o  tst_elena_out.nc -c 0:-1:0:1024:256:256 tst_elena_int_3D.nc
````

Generally a range of settings must be tested. This is best done with a shell script, which calls bf_file repeatedly, to create output like this:

Such tables are suitable for import into spreadsheets, for easy graphing of results.

Several test scripts are run during the “make check” of the netCDF build, in the `nc_test4/` directory.
The following example may be found in `nc_test4/run_bm_elena.sh`.

The reading that `bm_file` does can be tailored to match the expected access pattern.

The `bm_file` program is controlled with command line options.
