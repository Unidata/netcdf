# Appendix C. NUG Style Guide {#nug_style_guide}

[TOC]
\tableofcontents

The NUG is being converted from either straight doxygen (typically `.dox` files) or mixed doxygen/markdown files (typically `.md` files).
During the conversion, we will apply the following style conventions.  
This list may expand.

For the time being, the final files will use some `doxygen` conventions, as we are converting the source files but we are **not**, as of yet, removing the NUG from the `doxygen` ecosystem.

These conventions should also be used when adding new documentation to the NetCDF Users Guide.

## Style Conventions {#nug_style_conventions}

* File names end with the `.md` prefix.
* Files are organized one rendered page per file, in markdown format.  *This may require splitting some .dox files (which can contain multiple rendered pages) into multiple files*.
* **Raw HTML** is considered valid markdown.
* Paragraphs written one sentence per line, with no blank space between them.  Blank spaces denote different paragraphs. This helps with diff viewing.

The following table shows the various `html` and `doxygen` tags which may exist in the existing documentation, and what the corresponding `markdown` syntax should be.
