[//]: # (TODO: Decide if NcML should be included in the NUG. And what should be pulled from netCDF-Java.)
<!-- Current docs on netCDF-Java NCML page: https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-java/current/userguide/basic_ncml_tutorial.html -->

The NetCDF Markup Language (NcML) is an XML dialect for representing the structure and data of a binary netCDF dataset (similar to CDL).
NcML can also be used to modify and aggregate existing datasets into new virtual dataset.
This capability is currently supported by the netCDF-Java library and used extensively by the THREDDS Data Server (TDS).
