##  What is NetCDF?

NetCDF is:
* Data models
* File formats (encodings)
* APIs
* Libraries

<!-- NOTE:
Text from NUG/netcdf_data_set_components.md#data_model, paragraph 1
-->

A netCDF dataset contains named dimensions, variables, and attributes.
These components can be used together to capture the meaning of data
and relations among data fields in an array-oriented dataset.
