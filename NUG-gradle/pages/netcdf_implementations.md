## Unidata Reference(?) Implementations

The Unidata Program Center supports and maintains the freely distributed netCDF-C and netCDF-Java libraries as well as both Fortran and C++ wrapper libraries.
NetCDF is also supported in Python, IDL, MATLAB, R, Ruby, and Perl.

For general netCDF information, see the main [Unidata netCDF page](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/).

For details on the Unidata supported libraries, see the library specific documentation pages:
* [netCDF-C User's Guide](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-c/current/)
* [netCDF-Fortran User's Guide](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-fortran/current/)
* [netCDF-C++ User's Guide](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-cxx/current/)
* [netCDF-Java User's Guide](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-java/current/userguide/)
