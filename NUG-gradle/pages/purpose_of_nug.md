The "NetCDF User's Guide" describes netCDF to any user,
independent of which library/tool they use.
It describes the netCDF data models and file formats
independent of the various software implementations.
It also provides community conventions and best practices.
It contains information about netCDF that is of interest across specific implementations.

<!-- NOTE:
Text from Roadmap.md
-->

NUG is a document that describes netCDF to any user of netCDF,
independent of which library/tool they use. Including

* Best practices
* Basic attribute conventions (units, valid_min, etc.)
* How to use netCDF (gallery of tools)
* External conventions (e.g., CF, UGRID) - see current list/page

NUG is a document to captures technical details
(maybe in Appendix) needed by developers of an implementation of netCDF

Document to describe netCDF to e.g. program manager, data producer,
data user, data manager

Document with technical details for anyone working
on a netCDF implementation
based on one of the formats
(e.g. netCDF-4 based on HDF5 for h5netcdf,
ncZarr based on Zarr for netCDF-java)
